ascii-canvas
---------

ascii-canvas simulates a code page 437 ASCII terminal display. It supports all
256 characters of codepage 437, arbitrary foreground colors, arbitrary
background colors, and arbitrary terminal sizes.

This should be useful to roguelike developers.

THe API and code are strongly based on [Trystan's AsciiPanel for Java](https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel).
